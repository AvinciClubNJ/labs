## Purpose
This repository is used for teacher sharing code samples during the class. Don't use this for student homework.

## Guidelines
### ***Branches***
It is suggested to use the master branch only but keep code samples in different folders for each class or topic. 

    e.g.

        lab-|-lab1 // code samples for class 1
            |-lab2 // code samples for class 2
            |-lab3 // code samples for class 3
            |-labList // code samples for list

### ***Tags***
If you want to show each steps how your code sample being fleshed out, you can use tag with suggested tag name like "lab1.step1", "lab1.step2", etc. In this way you can checkout the tags one by one to show your code sample step by step. Remember to fetch/pull all tags("git fetch --tags" or "git pull --tags") when you update your local git.
